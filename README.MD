# Overview of Go
* __Go__ is a programming language that is stupidly simple & opinionated.  It is fully __compiled__ like C and therefore efficient. Its main superiority over other system languages is, that it caters for loading multiple CPUâ€™s efficiently and transparently. 

* __Go__ is designed specifically as a systems programming language for large, distributed systems and highly-scalable network servers. In that vein, it replaces C++ and Java in Google (company)'s software stack.

# Advantages Of Go
* clarity & simplicity is really what make it easy for people to get started with Go.
* Go has good concurrency support, which is essential for a language designed after 2002, and for companies who have a million servers waiting to be spun up. 

# Features Of Go
*  It is a a statically typed language that compiles very quickly to a binary executable.
